Technologies: C#, .NET Framework, Visual Studio, SQL Server

Description: Developed a Library Management System to manage books, members, and borrow records efficiently. The system includes features for CRUD operations on books, members, and borrow records, ensuring seamless data management and validation. The repository pattern was implemented for data access, with SQL Server as the backend database.

Achievements:
Designed and implemented a modular repository pattern for data access, improving code maintainability and scalability.
Created user-friendly functionality for managing books, members, and borrow records, including borrowing history with associated member and book details.
Ensured data consistency with input validations and proper handling of nullable fields (e.g., return dates).
Enhanced practical understanding of SQL queries, ADO.NET, and C# programming.
